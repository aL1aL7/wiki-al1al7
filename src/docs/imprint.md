Welcome to my personal wiki/blog and digital notepad.

This site is a private project, serving as my own notepad for useful code snippets, commands, and technical notes. Instead of searching for solutions repeatedly online, I collect and organize them here for quick access. In the future, there may be some private posts, but currently, this wiki is not intended for public blogging or commercial use.

The site is self-hosted and built with [Zensical](https://zensical.org/){:target="_blank"}.
