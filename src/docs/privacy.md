# Privacy Policy

We are pleased about your visit to our website [https://wiki.al1al7.de](https://wiki.al1al7.de) and your interest in our company and our offers. Despite careful content control, we assume no liability for external links to third-party content, as we have not initiated the transmission of this information, nor have we selected or modified the recipients of the transmitted information or the information itself.

The protection of your personal data during collection, processing, and use on the occasion of your visit to our website is an important concern for us and takes place within the framework of legal regulations, about which you can find information at, for example, [www.bfd.bund.de](http://www.bfd.bund.de).

In the following, we explain what information we collect during your visit to our websites and how it is used:

## 1. Collection and Storage of Personal Data as well as the Nature and Purpose of Their Use

### a) When visiting the website
Whenever a customer (or other visitor) accesses our website, information is automatically sent to our website's server by the internet browser used on your end device (computer, laptop, tablet, smartphone, etc.). This information is temporarily stored in a so-called log file.

The following data is collected without your intervention and stored until automated deletion:

- IP address of the requesting computer, as well as device ID or individual device identifier and device type,
- Name of the retrieved file and amount of data transferred, as well as the date and time of retrieval,
- Notification of successful retrieval,
- Requesting domain,
- Description of the type of internet browser used and, if applicable, the operating system of your end device as well as the name of your access provider,
- Your browser history data as well as your standard weblog information.

Our legitimate interest according to Art. 6 Para. 1 Sentence 1 lit. f GDPR for collecting the data is based on the following purposes: ensuring a smooth connection setup and comfortable use of the website, evaluation of system security and stability, and for further administrative purposes.

Under no circumstances do we use the collected data for the purpose of drawing conclusions about your person.

### b) When using our contact form

For questions of any kind, we offer you the opportunity to contact us using a form provided on the website. At least the following information is required so that we know from whom the request originates and to be able to answer it. Further information can be provided voluntarily.

Data processing for the purpose of contacting us is carried out in accordance with Art. 6 Para. 1 Sentence 1 lit. a GDPR on the basis of your voluntarily given consent.

The personal data collected by us for the use of the contact form will be automatically deleted after the request you have made has been dealt with.

### c) Upon conclusion of a contractual relationship

Upon conclusion of a contractual relationship on our website, we ask you to provide the following personal data:

- Further personal data that we are legally obliged or entitled to collect and process and which we require for your authentication, identification, or to verify the data we have collected.

The aforementioned data will be processed to handle the contractual relationship. The processing of the data is based on Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. b GDPR. The storage period is limited to the purpose of the contract and, if available, legal and contractual retention obligations.

## 2. Disclosure of Personal Data

A transfer of your data to third parties for purposes other than those listed below does not take place. We only pass on your data to third parties if:

- You have given your express consent to this (Art. 6 Para. 1 Sentence 1 lit. a GDPR),
- This is necessary for the processing of contractual relationships with you (Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. b GDPR),
- There is a legal obligation to pass it on (Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. c GDPR),
- The disclosure is necessary to assert, exercise, or defend legal claims and there is no reason to assume that you have an overriding interest worthy of protection in not disclosing your data (Art. 6 Para. 1 Sentence 1 lit. f GDPR).

In these cases, however, the scope of the transmitted data is limited to the required minimum.

Our data protection regulations are in harmony with the applicable data protection provisions and the data is processed only in the Federal Republic of Germany / European Union. A transfer to third countries does not take place and is not intended.

## 3. Rights of Data Subjects

Upon request, we will be happy to inform you whether and which personal data about you is stored (Art. 15 GDPR), in particular about the processing purposes, the category of personal data, the categories of recipients to whom your data has been or will be disclosed, the planned storage period, the existence of a right to rectification, deletion, restriction of processing or objection, the existence of a right of appeal, the origin of your data if it was not collected by us, and the existence of automated decision-making including profiling.

- You also have the right to have any incorrectly collected personal data corrected or incompletely collected data completed (Art. 16 GDPR).
- Furthermore, you have the right to demand that we restrict the processing of your data, provided that the legal requirements for this are met (Art. 18 GDPR).
- You have the right to receive the personal data concerning you in a structured, common, and machine-readable format or to request transmission to another controller (Art. 20 GDPR).
- In addition, you are entitled to the so-called "right to be forgotten," i.e., you can demand that we delete your personal data, provided that the legal requirements for this are met (Art. 17 GDPR).

Irrespective of this, your personal data will be automatically deleted by us if the purpose of the data collection no longer applies or the data processing has taken place unlawfully.

According to Art. 7 Para. 3 GDPR, you have the right to revoke your consent once given to us at any time. As a result, we may no longer continue the data processing based on this consent for the future.

You also have the right to object to the processing of your personal data at any time, provided that a right of objection is provided for by law. In the event of an effective revocation, your personal data will also be automatically deleted by us (Art. 21 GDPR).

If you wish to make use of your right of revocation or objection, an email to [info@al1al7.de](mailto:info@al1al7.de) is sufficient.

In the event of violations of data protection regulations, you have the possibility to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority according to Art. 77 GDPR.

## 4. Duration of Data Storage

The collected data will be stored by us as long as this is necessary for the execution of the contracts entered into with us or as long as you have not exercised your right to deletion or your right to data transfer to another company.

## 5. Cookies

We use cookies on our website. These are small text files that your browser creates automatically and that are stored on your end device when you visit our website. Information is stored in the cookie that arises in connection with the specific end device used. However, this does not mean that we gain direct knowledge of your identity. These cookies are set as so-called first-party cookies ("own cookies") or third-party cookies. First-party cookies are set by the website you are currently on and are not made accessible by browsers across domains. A third-party cookie, on the other hand, is set by a third party, i.e., not by the actual website you are currently on. Cookies are also differentiated into technically necessary and technically unnecessary cookies. Both technically necessary cookies and technically unnecessary cookies are set on our website in accordance with the following paragraphs.

Technically necessary cookies are strictly required for the operation of our website and, for example, enable certain functions in the first place. These technically necessary cookies, which are only required and set for the individual necessary online session, are automatically deleted after leaving our website.

Insofar as you have declared the corresponding consent, we use so-called technically unnecessary cookies on our site. Technically unnecessary cookies mainly serve to evaluate the use of the website and user behavior, to compile reports on the activities of visitors to the website, and to provide further services associated with the use of the website. The technically unnecessary cookies we use are explained in our cookie banner with regard to functionality, duration, and possible third-party recipients of the data. If certain third-party providers used by us set cookies as part of the service provided for us, this is additionally pointed out separately in our privacy policy. The legal basis for the use of technically unnecessary cookies is Art. 6 Para. 1 Sentence 1 lit. a GDPR, provided you have given your consent. You can revoke your consent at any time. Furthermore, you have the option to configure the setting of cookies at any time. For example, you can set your browser so that it informs you about the setting of cookies beforehand or completely disables cookies.

Java applets and JavaScript are used in the provision of our internet offer. If you do not want to make use of these auxiliary programs or active content for security reasons, you should deactivate the corresponding setting in your browser.

## 6. Online Marketing/Analysis Tools

None.

### YouTube

Plugins from YouTube (belonging to Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA) are used on our website. When you open our website, it establishes a direct connection to YouTube's servers via your browser. This transmits the information to YouTube that you have accessed our website. If you are logged into your YouTube account, the visit to our website and all of your interactions in connection with the plugin (e.g., clicking the YouTube button) can be assigned to your YouTube profile and stored at YouTube—even if you do not have a YouTube profile, it cannot be ruled out that YouTube stores your IP address. In this respect, please also note the YouTube privacy policy: [https://www.google.de/intl/de/policies/privacy/](https://www.google.de/intl/de/policies/privacy/).

To prevent YouTube from collecting data when you visit our website, log out of YouTube before visiting. To prevent general access by YouTube to your data via websites, you can exclude YouTube plugins through an add-on for your browser (e.g., [https://www.youtube.com/user/disconnecters](https://www.youtube.com/user/disconnecters)).

## Data Security

We strive for all necessary technical and organizational security measures to store your personal data in such a way that it is accessible neither to third parties nor to the public. Should you wish to contact us by email, we point out that the confidentiality of the transmitted information cannot be fully guaranteed with this communication path. We therefore recommend that you send us confidential information exclusively by post.

## Timeliness and Amendment of this Privacy Policy

This privacy policy is currently valid.

Due to the further development of our website and offers or due to changed legal or official requirements, it may become necessary to change this privacy policy. The current privacy policy can be accessed and printed out by you at any time on the website at [https://wiki.al1al7.de/privacy/](https://wiki.al1al7.de/privacy/).
